              The first ever outing with the entire team after the club was

              of Pune’s largest vegetable market on a Sunday morning. It was
              honestly a great place to get shots for street photography and
              portrait photography as well.

              The most awaited day every year, traditional day is special in
              several ways. To make it more colorful we photographers turn
              ourselves into artists and carpenters making photo frames and
              backdrops for everyone to click pictures in, wearing beautiful
              outfits.

              The first time that we came up with idea of giving a personalized
              twist to our regular traditional day; we merely had 4 days to get
              everything in order and can’t say we didn’t end up working until
              late every single day just to finish in time with our beautiful
              backdrops and photo frames. This was the first time the entire
              team was doing something so different. Working together in this
              one event created an amazing bonding between us that continues
              till date.
