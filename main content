3. A long shutterbugs description.
    3.1 starting of the club-
Team Shutterbugs came into existence in the year 2017, as an initiative of our club head Mr. Aryan Sharma who was then in the first year of Civil Engg. At such a young age our head worked hard to establish this club with the help of 8 other batch mates. In the year 2018, the club opened itself to recruit new members. This was the first time our club was officially managing as well as documenting events like Summit, Nirmitee and BCS and got recognized and appreciated for its work. 
Today our club has over 60 members who are able to successfully manage multiple college events and work together as a club. Shutterbugs being the only team that documents all the college events with such amazing efficiency and quality is now recognized by our college management and is proudly known as the Official Photography Club Of MIT-WPU. 
    
3.2 our aim- 
For us, the camera is a sketchbook, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity. We here at MIT-WPU Shutterbugs are committed to bring memories to life with everything we have. The feeling of learning from one other is mutual and that is what binds our club together. The will to overpower difficulties and learn from mistakes is our biggest strength making us unparalleled. It has always been an attempt to do something out of the box may it be, photography, videography or graphic designing. A photograph takes an instant out of time, altering life by holding it still for eternity in our souls.
 
    3.4 our vision-
We wish to bring together all the creative minds on the same platform to give them an opportunity to exploit your abilities. It’s not just about clicking the best photographs or shooting the best video clips, it’s about the ability to bring a moment back to life that happened long ago, to cherish what it would have been. Photography is like a spark in the mind, fan it with enough air and you will get the best flame ever. Also, to be able to work in team now, will help you to be able to lead a team in your future during the professional life.
	
    3.5 our experience ( in brief  try to cover all events ):
Shutterbugs has taken the responsibility of a ‘Quality Press Release’ since the very dawn of the club. We believe in providing nothing, but the best quality “Media And Publicity”. We have been working diligently to put forward the best content from our side. Our biggest strength is to be able to work in a team, with sync. What makes the club even more functional is the extra ordinary coordination amongst the members. The club has been more like a family instead, where all the club members are ready to provide all the help to every counter part as and when needed.
We, together had the opportunity to work for all the major events like:
1. MITWPU Summit: The Official Inter Collegiate Sports meet, having students from all over the country to participate.
2. MITWPU Aarohan: The Official Cultural fest having students from all over the country to showcase a variety of their talents, as well as renown guests who motivate these participants to strive harder.
3. MITWPU Nirmitee: The Event of our Civil Department, where numerous activities/competitions based on civil engineering as well as some non-technical ones are organized. 
4. MITWPU Texephyr: The joint-department technical Workshop/Competition of Computer Science, Mechanical and ENTC Dept.
5. MITWPU Vasundhara- The Annual meet of our college, also known as the Traditional Day which includes inter-departmental competitions and performances. Our club also sets up multiple attractions for students on this day.
6. MITWPU Winter School: The CS Department’s week long technical event/Workshop. 
7. MITWPU Syntropy: The technical inter-collegiate event/competition of the Chemical Department of our College.
8. Bhartiya Chhatra Sansad and National Teacher’s congress.
are some of the noted events that we coordinate with.
 
    3.6 how we are different.
We at MIT-WPU Shutterbugs are more like a family than an official club. We believe that we always have scope for improvement and so we always try to find ways to expand our knowledge and gain practical experience of the same. Apart from covering all the official events and fests, we conduct many unofficial activities and competitions for our club members and sometimes everyone. These include photo-walks, treks, competitions on our social media handles, photo galleries, workshops and a lot more. This makes the learning process a lot more fun and interesting. We also help our novice members in developing their skills and help them gain a better perspective from behind the lens. During the recruitment process, trained photographers or designers is not all we are looking for (of course they are more than welcome) but anyone with a keen interest and a strong drive for learning photography or graphic designing along with a little basic knowledge is welcome to the club. 
 Ours is not a technical, study related club. This is a club that brings together people from different departments of the university having a common passion and interest which makes it a great experience for each and every member of the club. Even though the team works hard during the events, it doesn’t seem like work because we are too busy enjoying whatever we are doing. And working hard for something you love is called passion- is what we believe in.
 
4. A short description about various departments in the club. The club has three main departments- Photography, Videography and Graphic Designing.
The Photography and Videography departments cover all the events that take place in and out of the campus with a keen eye. The club is well equipped in terms of technology as well as personnel to handle all aspects of covering any event or activity. Up to date equipments and accessories play a key role in this process. The club also has a drone at its disposal along with people trained to use it, which gives the best cinematic shots in our video documentaries.
The Graphic Designing department takes care of designing posters and banners for our college events. Apart from that they also design badges, t-shirts and other accessories for the individuals taking part in the specific events. Not only are these but the certificates that are given to participants and volunteers designed by our graphic designing team as well. We have a team of hardworking designers well equipped with the knowledge of complex softwares like photoshop, illustrator, after effects, c4d and blender. All things considered, we could proudly say that we are a pretty self sufficient team capable of managing college events quite successfully.

*********************************************************************************************

Arai trek:
A day spent in the woods under a clear sunny sky in the city’s popular trekking spot, The Arai Hills along with the team.
Basic photography workshop:
Our team members welcomed the newly recruited first year team mates with this Basic Photography Workshop to help them learn about some basic skills and get to know all the team members.
Korigad trek:
Woke up early on a Sunday morning to go on a fun journey, away from the hustle of the city to the mighty Fortress of Korigadh. 
Korigad go pro shot:
In the burning afternoon heat after reaching the top, water looked quite refreshing! This picture was taken by our senior on his go pro camera with the entire crew by the lake on top of Korigadh.
Long exposure photography:
This one was an interesting workshop; we organized a Long Exposure Photography workshop with our own equipment in our own college auditorium. Not to mention it was a huge success and we had a lot of fun with lights and cameras!
Mandai Photowalk:
The first ever outing with the entire team after the club was formed. A photowalk was organized to capture the hustle and bustle of Pune’s largest vegetable market on a Sunday morning. It was honestly a great place to get shots for street photography and portrait photography as well.
Nikon ws:
We collaborated with Nikon to conduct a photography workshop in our college and got to use the latest Mirrorless Technology in the new Nikon Z6 cameras with professional guidance. That was a fun experience!
Nikon publicity:
Photography isn’t the only thing we do as a club. A lot of planning and plotting goes into each and every workshop and competition that we organize. Here we are doing publicity of our upcoming Nikon workshop in our college campus.
Official hoodie:
The day when it all looked so real, we finally got our own customized hoodies , it felt amazing almost as if we were being given something so precious; a reminder that we stuck around in this team for after all this time, from being strangers to almost a second family. Cheers Team Shutterbugs!
Trad day 2020:
The most awaited day every year, traditional day is special in several ways. To make it more colorful we photographers turn ourselves into artists and carpenters making photo frames and backdrops for everyone to click pictures in, wearing beautiful outfits.
Trad day 2019:
The first time that we came up with idea of giving a personalized twist to our regular traditional day; we merely had 4 days to get everything in order and can’t say we didn’t end up working until late every single day just to finish in time with our beautiful backdrops and photo frames. This was the first time the entire team was doing something so different. Working together in this one event created an amazing bonding between us that continues till date.
